/* The program must accept two integers X and Y as the input. The program must print the
largest possible integer which is formed by concatenating the binary representations of X and
Y as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 < = X, Y < = 10
Input Format:
The first line contains X and Y separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the largest possible integer which is formed by concatenating the binary
representations of X and Y.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input
710
Output:
122
Explanation:
The binary representation of 7 is 111.
The binary representation of 10 is 1010.
So 122 is printed as the output. */
